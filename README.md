Python-Challenge
In this repository is the two codes that I constructed to solve the challenges.
I chose to do two separate styles of code to exercise the full extent of knowledge gained over the past couple weeks.
My code was created in collaboration with my peers (Kiet Hoang, Mike Pointek, Patrick Dean, Katie Ballinger, Jordan Underwood, Mia Hursh, and Sarah Schilling)
I also used Open AI via ChatGPT-4 to help debug some instances of the code where I was stuck.  
The two text files save the results of the code.
